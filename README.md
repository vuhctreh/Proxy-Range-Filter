# Proxy-Range-Filter
Filters proxies in a txt file based on the numbers before the first dot (e.g. 123.xxx.xxx.xxx will remove all proxies that start with 123)

This is my first Go project. It takes in an input for the file name (which should be place in the same directory as the go program) and the range to delete.
The output is a text file named "test.txt" with the filtered output.
